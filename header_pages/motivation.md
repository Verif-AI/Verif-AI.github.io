Verif.AI is an AI-powered fact-checking browser extension that allows you to quickly detect misinformation! Not only can it provide a true/false veracity statement, but it can also provide a justification behind its answer, a score to determine how trustworthy our justification is, and additional sources to check for yourself

## The Price of Misinformation

In today's digital age, social media has become a primary source of information, but it also presents a growing ethical challenge: the spread of misinformation. This unchecked flow of false or misleading content can have a profound impact on society, eroding trust in credible sources, polarizing viewpoints, and even leading to real-world harm. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we've seen firsthand how false information about the virus spread like wildfire.  An [article from CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cost-of-covid-19-misinformation-study-1.6726356) found that misinformation led to an estimated **2.8 thousand lost lives** and a staggering **300 million dollars in damages** in Canada alone. These aren't just numbers â€“ they represent lives lost and communities disrupted.

Left unchecked, misinformation weakens the foundations of a healthy society; it breeds distrust in the very institutions we rely on for guidance and protection. This is precisely why we've developed this browser extension. By empowering people to critically evaluate online content, we aim to create a more informed and resilient online community.
