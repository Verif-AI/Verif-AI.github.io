Verif.AI is an AI-powered fact-checking browser extension that allows you to quickly detect misinformation! Not only can it provide a true/false veracity statement, but it can also provide a justification behind its answer, a score to determine how trustworthy our justification is, and additional sources to check for yourself

## The Price of Misinformation

As researchers and developers deeply concerned with the well-being of our communities, we understand the devastating impact misinformation can have. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we've seen firsthand how false information about the virus spread like wildfire.  This wasn't just about frustrating inaccuracies; a CBC study found it led to an estimated 2.8 thousand lost lives and a staggering 300 million dollars in damages in Canada alone.  These are real people, families, and communities forever changed.  Misinformation erodes trust in vital institutions, hinders public health efforts, and ultimately costs lives. That's why we're committed to developing tools like this browser extension to empower everyone to navigate the online world with greater discernment.
